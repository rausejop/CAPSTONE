# ADR-001: Pipeline for Multi-Modal Intelligence Tool (8GB Optimized)

## Status
Accepted (Updated for 2026 Hardware Constraints)

## Context
The system requires a unified processing pipeline to handle diverse data inputs 
(Web, Social Media, PDFs) while operating within an 8 GB free RAM overhead. 
Target models include Llama 3.2 (3B) or Mistral Nemo (12B) using 4-bit 
quantization to prevent OOM (Out of Memory) crashes.

## Functional Requirements & Architecture Mapping

| Code   | Requirement               | Implementation Detail (2026 Tech Stack)           |
| :---   | :---                      | :---                                               |
| FUNC01 | Sentiment Analysis        | LangChain + Ollama (Llama 3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M)  |
| FUNC02 | Social Network Analysis   | Playwright (Headless) + Metadata Extraction        |
| FUNC03 | Automatic Translation     | Ollama-based zero-shot translation                 |
| FUNC04 | Web Scraping & Clipping   | LangChain WebBaseLoader / BeautifulBS4             |
| FUNC05 | Topic Clustering          | ChromaDB (Persistent) + FastEmbed / Sentence-Trans |
| FUNC06 | Text-to-Speech (TTS)      | gTTS or Piper (Low Latency / Low RAM)              |

## Decision: Sequential Integrated Pipeline
We utilize a "Collector-Transformer-Synthesizer" flow optimized for local CPU/GPU offloading:
1. Ingestion: Playwright fetches dynamic content; PDFs are chunked via LangChain.
2. Processing: Data is embedded into ChromaDB using memory-efficient 4-bit models.
3. Intelligence: Mistral/Llama perform sentiment and clustering via Ollama API.
4. Output: Command-line verbose logs + Matplotlib visualization of clusters.
5. Theory: Put insinde 05_Theory directory important concepts used in this pipleine when used in the platform

## Consequences
* Pros: Runs on consumer-grade laptops; no API costs; 4-bit quantization keeps 
  latency low.
* Cons: Sequential processing is required to stay under the 8GB RAM ceiling; 
  large PDF batches may require disk-swapping.
